This folder holds ipynb files, that are used to create the prediction models for the website. These
files use python, but will need to be run using jupyter notebook, or through google colab. There is
advantage to using this type of file while doing machine learning it lets you easily run specific chunks
of code and not others. Often when doing machine learning functions and tests, can run for hours, so
being able to run specific things without running others becomes invaluable. 

Right now, just running all the cells won't take terribly long to run, the eventual goal is to add 
the predictions to the database. We still need to work to get to that point.
