# Django
Here be the django server. Not much is implemented yet.

The server can be started by navigating to this directory and running the command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
The web application will be visible at the address `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Stop the server by pressing `CTRL+c` in the console.

The admin panel is accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`. 

Login username: `admin`

Login password: `fintech`

Eventually this will be changed, we'll likely create admin accounts for everyone that needs one.
